      AI tools are powerful, but not always worth the cost.
      This calculator helps you see if you're actually saving time or earning more than you're spending.
    </p>
    <p>
      I built this tool as a way to help creators, freelancers, and solo builders make smarter decisions in a world full of $29/month subscriptions.
      There's no login, no tracking, and no gimmicks — just math.

      I plan to expand this site with blogs, comparisons, and ROI breakdowns for every major AI tool on the market. Stay tuned.
